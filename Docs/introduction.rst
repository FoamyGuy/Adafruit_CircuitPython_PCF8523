Introduction to Adafruit's PCF8523 Real Time Clock (RTC) Library
================================================================

This is a great battery-backed real time clock (RTC) that allows your
microcontroller project to keep track of time even if it is reprogrammed,
or if the power is lost. Perfect for datalogging, clock-building, time
stamping, timers and alarms, etc. Equipped with PCF8523 RTC - it can
run from 3.3V or 5V power & logic!

The PCF8523 is simple and inexpensive but not a high precision device.
It may lose or gain up to two seconds a day. For a high-precision,
temperature compensated alternative, please check out the
`DS3231 precision RTC. <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3013>`_
If you need a DS1307 for compatibility reasons, check out our
`DS1307 RTC breakout <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3296>`_.
